<b>Updated 14 March 2017 > V3.1 - Release</b><br>
Fixed - missing bracket on cashbandits mission <br>
Fixed - logic off on ifrit mission for vehicle <br>
Thanks to jweisner for spotting <br>

<b>Updated 10 March 2017 > V3.1 - Release</b><br>
Added new nedcashbandits_mission with %vehicle and cash prize <br>

Updated 16 July 2016 > V 3.0 - Release
1. Changed the random call from 
_difficulty = _PossibleDifficulty call BIS_fnc_selectRandom;
to
_difficulty = selectRandom _PossibleDifficulty;
2. Changed difficulty match from
if (_difficulty isEqualTo "easy") then {
to
switch (_difficulty) do
{	case "easy":	{
*** #1 and #2 is to match the way DMS has released some of the missions from this pack and to make updates easier in the future ***
3. Consolidated start messages into 1 line as I saw how eraser1 had changed scripts for including into DMS and realised I missed a trick as this reduces the amount of lines in the script.
4. Consolidated some of the item content choices as I had listed the same lines in all outcomes but really just needed to list once to reduce size of script (again thanks eraser1).
5. Adjusted some spacing, line breaks and tabs as it reduces the overall size and was not really needed.
6. Changed terrorists to bandits to keep in the Bandit Missions theme, and corrected some English grammar.
7. Added % chance of persistent vehicle to more missions so it can be adjusted by user.
8. Changed CoinToss possibilities a % number.
9. Removed several mistakes in brackets - I don't know how I missed them or why it worked anyway but I fixed them.
10. Balanced some AI and loot as they were a little under or over what you would expect from the missions.
11. Added a graded %chance for persistent vehicles on some missions - check the spreadsheet for details.
12. ***NEW MISSION*** - nedbandit1, no crate but loot and cash spawn inside the vehicle. This has almost every function I have been working on inside including 2 groups of custom AI - kind of like the old Mayor missions of the Arma 2 days where one Ai is dressed differently from the rest. It is a working concept and "how to" mission so not only works as a mission but can help people design and release more of their own.

Updated 14 June 2016 > V 2.0 - Release
1. Changed Difficulty chance mechanism to use the BIS_fnc_selectRandom function.
2. Added all possible difficulties into file and let user decide what to pick from.
3. Removed suffix's from mission as all could now easily do all 4 difficulties.
4. Added more randomisation to crate filling for all missions.
5. Balanced missions against each other a little better.
6. Added persistent vehicles to some missions when it goes into hardcore but other difficulties remain non-persistent including:
don'tHasseltheHoff
nedbuilding1_mission
nedguns1_mission
nedmedical1_mission
nedresearch_mission
7. nedcar and nedHatchback missions now have chance of better car for hardcore difficulty
8. Thieves, nedlittlebird missions don't give persistent vehicles on easy difficulty.
9. Added random choice of SUV's into car dealer mission plus 50/50 chance for either 1 or 2 vehicles.
10. nedUral and nedOffroad missions give 50/50 chance of persistent vehicle when mission is on easy difficulty.
11. nedSniper mission has been consolidated to include hardcore with persistent vehicle and also the multi squad AI formations.
12. nedHunter, nedIfrit and  nedStrider missions on easy spawn non persistent vehicle, 50% chance persistent on moderate and 100% persistent on difficult and hardcore.
I have tried to keep the section formatting of the scripts for ease of editing although it may not be the most optimal way.
